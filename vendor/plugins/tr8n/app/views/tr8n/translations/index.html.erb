	<div style="color:red">Thoughts about translations: A translation gets a vote by the translator. (They can downvote it if they don't like their suggestion anymore and can create a new translation. They can also delete their translations, but maybe they don't want the old one to get lost.) A beta looks over a translation and votes. (Maybe a second beta votes, too.) In inline translation mode, we can show different colours for differnt amount of votes or give other indicators so translators see where work is needed. If a translator changes their translations, votes get reset. The translation with the most votes is the one currently used on the site. There are comments attached to a translation so that people can discuss.</div>
