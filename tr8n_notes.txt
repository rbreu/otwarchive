To get tr8n running:

1.) (Hack, need better solution) Remove "description" and "rules" from FIELDS_ALLOWING_HTML in local.yml, because some of the tr8n tables have description fields too and it's messing with our monkey patching.

2.) Run:

$ rake tr8n:sync
$ rake db:migrate
$ rake tr8n:init

3.) Run:

$ ./hacky_tr8n_config_paster.rb 

(Hack to work around the reloading plugin from overwriting our config.)
